# Divvy
Divvy was created by my roommate and I to help manage our collective finances better. 
We were struggling to track which food delivery and grocery expense were attributed to each person and needed a way
to keep track of expenses incurred and expenses outstanding. To do this, we created Divvy to automate the process as
much as possible.
